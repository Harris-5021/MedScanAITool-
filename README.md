# MedScan: AI-Powered Pneumonia Detection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This project was created for my final year project as part of my university degree. 
- Below are three recorded videos that were made throughout the project.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilises a state-of-the-art neural network model to analyze chest X-rays.
- **Pneumonia Detection**: Accurately identifies the presence of pneumonia in uploaded X-ray images.
- **Probability Score**: Provides a probability percentage indicating the likelihood of pneumonia.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading and analyzing X-ray images.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices, from desktop to mobile.

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Users upload a chest X-ray image through the web interface.
2. **Analysis**: Our AI model processes the image using advanced computer vision techniques.
3. **Results**: The system displays the analysis results, including:
   - Detection of pneumonia (positive or negative)
   - Probability score indicating the likelihood of pneumonia

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: ASP.NET Core
- AI Model: TensorFlow.js
- Database: SQL.

## Installation and Setup
- Need to have .net8 installed
- This project uses an mvc model
- database can be used locally e.g. sql server management studio

## Usage

1. Navigate to the MedScan homepage.
2. Register an account
3. Login to account
4. Click on the "Analyse X-ray" button.
5. Upload a chest X-ray image.
6. Wait for the analysis to complete.
7. View the results, including the pneumonia detection and probability score.
